To fix this, you need to:

1. Go to your Streamlit Cloud dashboard
2. Navigate to your app settings
3. Go to 'Secrets' section
4. Add your real xAI API key as: xai = 'your-actual-api-key-here'

The current placeholder key 'your-xai-api-key-here' needs to be replaced with your real API key from xAI.

Once you add the real API key to Streamlit secrets, the workflow will work correctly.
